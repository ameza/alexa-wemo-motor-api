**Alexa Wemo API**

Local Network API to control AD80 D80 Drapery Motor via Wemo Switch

The purpose of this api is to provide a rest endpoint that allows to toggle
the motor activation using a wemo switch.

The main idea is to controll the engine by voice using an amazon echo, with a custom skill
and a lambda function connected to this api.
