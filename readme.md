**Alexa Wemo API**

Local Network API to control AD80 D80 Drapery Motor via Wemo Switch

The purpose of this api is to provide a rest endpoint that allows to toggle
the motor activation using a wemo switch. The rotation can be customized allowing to 
keep motor going for a certain number of seconds, for example to open the courtains half way.

The main idea is to controll the engine by voice using an amazon echo, with a custom skill
and a lambda function connected to this api.
